neither fish nor fowl
next to nothing
nine to five 
no spring chicken
dead and buried
red ink
bag of bones
behind bars
bells and whistles
let sleeping dogs lie
pain in the neck
in a fog
in the bag
in the same boat
itchy feet
green light
old hat
fly on the wall
icing on the cake
red flag
